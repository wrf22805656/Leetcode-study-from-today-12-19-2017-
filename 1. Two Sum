# Question Description:

# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. 

# Example:

# Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

# Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2+7 =9

# return [0,1].
